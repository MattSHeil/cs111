Create an array of 1000 double datatype elements, store 7.5 times the array slot number as the value in each array slot.
Ask the user to enter an integer between 0 and 999 â€“ print the value of that element of the array (if the user entered 121 you would print the contents of array slot 121 which would be 907.5).
Input validation: Do not check out of range values!  Instead inform the user that the value is out of range.

Example Output:
Test Case 1:
Enter an array slot number: <40>
The value in array slot 40 is 300

Test Case 2:
Enter an array slot number: <0>
The value in array slot 0 is 0

Test Case 3:
Enter an array slot number: <999>
The value in array slot 999 is 7492.5

Test Case 4:
Enter an array slot number: <1000>
Value out of range.

Test Case 5:
Enter an array slot number: <-1>
Value out of range.
