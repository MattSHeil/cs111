Modify Lab 16 so that your function accepts an array of doubles instead of four individual double parameters.  Use a global constant for the array size and set it to 3.  Your program should not break if the constant is changed.  Since the function should not modify its’ array parameter be sure to set it to be const.
Contents of Lab 16:
Create a function that accepts four double values as parameters.  These four double values should NOT modify the related values in main.  The function should return the minimum of the four values, maximum of the four values, and average of the four values.  Hint: Remember pass-by-reference to return multiple values – your function should have seven parameters and a return type of void.
In main, ask the user to enter the four values, and then print the minimum, maximum and average.  Your function should NOT print anything or read in anything (no cin/cout), only main.
