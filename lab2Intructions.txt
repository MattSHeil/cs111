- Ask the user to enter their name, print “Hi [name]” to the screen.
- Ask the user whether they are a CS major or not – print the result to the screen as “CS Major: [result]” (note that this will display numerically – that is OK for now).
- Ask the user to enter their favorite punctuation mark – print “Your favorite punctuation mark is: [result].”
- Ask the user to enter two numbers – store them as integers.  Display the result of dividing the first by the second both as a decimal and as a value and remainder.

You should clearly communicate to the user what they need to enter for each input, and what you are displaying for each output.
All of your variables must be of appropriate data types.
